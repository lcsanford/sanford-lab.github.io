# Philosophy and group environment

Welcome to the SPIRES Lab at Yale School of the Environment! 

The SPIRES (Study of Policy and Institutions using Remote Environmental Sensing) lab is focused on environmental political economy and environmental data science. We seek to leverage new, high-dimensional sources of data, including satellite imagery and text, to answer questions at the frontier of human well-being, climate change, environmental policy, and economic development. Our research often examines how institutions shape incentives for environmental preservation or exploitation, and how people’s preferences for environmental and development policy are affected by the spatial and temporal distribution of consequences of those policies. We develop and implement machine learning methods paired with statistical causal inference to answer challenging policy questions, often in non-experimental settings. To this end, we develop and use novel methods to use remote sensing for impact evaluation. We use remote sensing to improve measurement of important environmental, economic, and social outcomes as well as to help us make better inferences of the effects of policy in complex human-natural systems. Our group includes students from the School of Environment and Forest School, as well as the Departments of Political Science, the Statistics and Data Science, Math, Engineering, and others.

The purpose of this document is to communicate information regarding our research group. This document provides you with guidance as to what will be expected of you and what you can expect from me during your time here. Although I believe that everything in this document may be applicable to you, some things may apply more or less to you than to others. As you read through this, please keep in mind that it is directed to a group of individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds and training. If you have questions, comments, and/or suggestions please let me know.

We work on outcomes including deforestation, land cover and land use change, economic development, migration, urbanization, political and social preferences for environmental protection and climate policy, and others. We focus on the effects of political institutions including electoral systems, bureaucratic incentives, and property rights, to name a few. 

Research should have an applied focus, but also make theoretical contributions. Triangulation through multiple methods is encouraged. The research itself should not veer into advocacy, but you are welcome to write more opinionated pieces for popular articles or commentaries.  Keep in mind that you should develop the evidence and expertise needed to justify your opinions before jumping directly into any commentary or advocacy work. 

We are building a diverse, collaborative, and constructive community that values interdisciplinary, problem-driven research. The goal is for our group to work as a team, with everyone chipping in to make our group and offices a pleasant, and perhaps even fun, place to work. To that end we will share responsibilities for organizing the office and events.  Please sign up here [create link to Google sheet]. 

## Roles

There is a wealth of general resources available throughout the YSE site and various Yale web presences in addition to physical offices and various events, workshops, and trainings. 

### Undergraduate students

We will start you with a basic task to evaluate your reliability and dedication, then as we get a feel for your skills and interests we will start to talk with you about independent project ideas. You will be expected to work independently and to ask questions when you need help.  You will be expected to attend lab meetings. 
### Graduate Students

My foremost objective is to provide mentoring and scientific training while you contribute to the research goals of the lab and advance your career. In addition to learning how to perform field and laboratory research, an important goal for you should be to develop excellent communication skills that will promote your advancement within the environmental and political sciences. This involves becoming a contributor who can present their own work, and a listener who can offer and accept constructive criticism. Thus, participating in lab meetings, seminars, and abstract, manuscript, and proposal preparation, as well as manuscript and proposal reviews will constitute an important part of your training. I encourage you to think about and revisit your professional goals periodically. I am supportive of you identifying opportunities to enhance your training and development as long they promote rather than detract from the primary purpose of the research group. Additionally, I encourage you to communicate your goals and plans with me. Communication is critical to a productive and healthy advisee/mentor relationship, and I can best help when I understand your goals. In addition to my comments, please read and refer to the general YSE handbook for Masters students, the specific handbook for MESc and MFS students, and the Doctoral Program Handbook. 

### Postdoctoral associates/fellows

The principal job of postdoctoral associates/fellows is to design, implement, analyze and write quantitatively rigorous studies in the areas of environmental political economy and environmental data science. Postdoctoral fellows take on leadership roles in the group with the possibility to mentor other lab members at the PhD, Masters, and Undergraduate levels. 

Postdoctoral positions are for one year with the option to renew for a second year contingent on performance and funding. Postdoctoral salaries are determined by the Yale Office for Postdoctoral Affairs. Postdoctoral associates will have funded research assistants and a research budget and are expected to spend a minimum of 50% of their time on collaborative lab projects led or co-led by the postdoc. The postdoctoral fellow will be primarily supervised by Prof. Luke Sanford and will collaborate with other postdocs, Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate students. My mentorship style will adapt to fit the professional interests and goals of the postdoc. One of the goals of the SPIRES lab is to support a diverse community of scholars by providing mentorship and support for academically under-represented groups.

## Work and Productivity

What you accomplish is more important than how and when you work. That being said, I want to create an effective motivational and collaborative environment. If you are out of the office and miss group meetings frequently, your absence will be noticed. So, when you are not conducting fieldwork, you are expected to work from the office at least 3 days a week. This must include days where we have scheduled group meetings. You are not expected to work beyond business hours or over the weekend unless there is an urgent need (e.g., a pressing deadline). Mental health and work/life balance are priorities. 

It is inevitable that you will get pulled into other research. If you are a postdoc, you will likely be spending time finishing publications that you started earlier. I ask that you inform me of additional projects outside of what is planned for your dissertation (if a Ph.D. student) or research project (if a postdoc, MA, or undergraduate). Please limit the time you spend on these “other” projects to an average of 1 day every other week (i.e., 10% of your time). This “other work” may not include work that you started as part of the main project but want to pursue as sole author. If the work draws on your project, it should not be sole author.

A good way to assess whether you are working smart versus working hard is your productivity.  When you start a new project, we will work together to create a list of concrete deliverables on a bi-weekly basis. If you are consistently missing deadlines for deliverables, we need to assess why it is happening.  On a yearly basis Ph.D. students should aim to submit one first author paper within the first two years, and one more paper in the third year. Your third paper should be well on its way before you will be allowed to defend. Postdocs should aim to publish one first-author and at least one co-author paper per year. You should have one first author paper from your funded project submitted by the end of the first year.

## Communication

One-on-One meetings: We have a template for 1:1 meeting notes. Please create an agenda for the meeting and send to me by midnight prior to the meeting. After the meeting, send me a link to your updated notes from the meeting, including next steps. (If you are already doing this, awesome! Keep your meeting notes history as it was and switch over to the new template for future meetings)

1:1 : [agenda template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9RpyHOBs7Sk-05sQ3eDV6qVsRSdf-06wA-k2s9cDgk/edit?usp=sharing)

Group meetings: For each of our lab meetings, we'll start off with a bit of group business and then have a lab member share their work for discussion with the group. If you'd like to present your work, or read and discuss a paper with the group, add it to the agenda!

[Lab Meeting Schedule & Agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m-yNQkCTXTO9CAIaVeAsDJ4iiAhooZctTbz5glLscMo/edit?usp=sharing)

Planning: Each member of the lab should complete an individual development plan once per year according to the template below. Additionally, it is expected that you will create a three-month work plan four times a year (Sept 1, Dec 1, Mar 1, &  June 1) and check in about your progress and challenges by email or in person toward this work plan every week. 

[Individual Development Plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z52xAGWbltX8ViMpKnL4ByEPfl9d2ZsmQ9Nb_NljVx0/edit?usp=sharing)

You are expected to attend lab group meetings and help foster a productive, constructive, and collaborative group environment. There will be opportunities for your professional development through advising undergraduate, master, and Ph.D. students and contributing guest lectures to classes. I may send you emails after core work hours, but I do not expect you to respond immediately.  I do expect you to respond within 2 days unless extenuating circumstances prevent you from doing so. I generally respond to email within a day. Feel free to resend your email again if you haven’t received a response in 2 days. If it is urgent or easy, I am available by Slack and phone (text is best).

Please feel free to stop by my office if my door is open.  If it is closed, I am on a call or unavailable. I am sporadically available on the weekend for quick responses.  But keep in mind I have a small child who takes up a lot of attention, so if you think you will need serious help over the weekend (e.g., deadline for a grant proposal is on Monday), please let me know well in advance. 

## Vacation and Travel Time 

Each student/post-doc should aim for __X_ weeks of vacation each calendar year per Yale policy. To keep track of everyone's holidays and work travel, there is a shared Google calendar.  Note: Unless I have to for a grant, I likely won’t be keeping strict track of things.  But I would like to better understand how long things take and I ask that you try to broadly account for time that you spend working over hours or during the weekends so that if you need to take extra time off versus what is written here you have some record of your overall balance of hours. Please remember to turn on your out-of-office automatic response if you are sick/on vacation and do not plan to respond to email. 

Use your time well, work efficiently, put in productive hours – strong efforts on your part will be noted positively by both me and you. That is, the more efficiently you work, the more productive you will be and the more you will want to work efficiently. It is a positive feedback loop.   

There will be times when you are more and less productive. Productivity ebbs and flows but the goal is to always make forward progress. If you feel that’s not the case – i.e., you’re stuck, stranded, spinning wheels, etc. then we need to re-evaluate goals and priorities. Let me know if you are having this feeling – we’ve all been there, it will happen more than once, and you can and will move past it.   

## Authorship 

I expect to be included as the last author on all publications resulting from the work we outlined for your position and papers that result from the data we collected together. Also, aside from the XX% of your time that is allocated to “other” projects, I expect to be included on all papers resulting from your time in my employ.  Whoever led the research and writing is typically the first author.  If two group members are working together, they can be designated as co-first authors, but should agree to that ahead of time to avoid conflict.  You should include all other group members who contribute to data collection, analysis, AND manuscript preparation. For me and everyone else, data collection and analysis is not a free pass to authorship.  If someone else gives you an idea for a paper and contributes substantially to the design, it is best to try to include them in other tasks along the way so that they can justifiably be included in the manuscript.  If you rely on someone in the group frequently for methodological support you should include them in the manuscript (and they should contribute to manuscript preparation). You should always include “SPIRES Lab, Yale University” in the affiliation of your work while you are employed with my group, regardless of whether I am a co-author (i.e., for the “other” work).

## Conduct and behavior

You are expected to maintain the highest level of scientific integrity. Honesty, constructive criticism, and trustworthiness are expected of you and your coworkers, and you should know what to do or who to contact if something goes wrong. Harassment is forbidden. Educate yourself on the various programs and policies that support belonging for everyone at Yale. If you are harassed or are made to feel uncomfortable by another team member, colleague, collaborator or any other person or persons within your professional life here at Yale please reach out to me. Should you so wish, we can discuss issues raised confidentially so long as I am not obliged by university regulations to raise the matter further (for example, if I think you will seriously harm yourself). If you do not feel comfortable talking to me, there are multiple points of contact to which you can go. A good starting point for any kind of sexual misconduct is the SHARE Center. You can also reach out to the Title IX Office at Yale. Familiarize yourself with Yale’s Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment which also lists contact information for questions and concerns. 

Please remember that research protocols, data, etc. can be considered intellectual property. This information should not be shared with others unless you have obtained my approval. Typically, I am happy to share, but circumstances may arise where that is not the case. You are expected to behave in a respectful, professional manner in the field, in the lab, at conferences, etc. You can expect the same from me. 

Please avoid making jokes or comments that may be perceived as harmful, e.g., comments related to race, gender and gender-orientation, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, etc. Avoid making fun of others’ work, particularly those who are more junior.

## Mental health

It is normal to struggle. You are encouraged and welcome to reach out to your advisor and your colleagues if you are struggling and need advice, or if you just want to talk. Please do that: if your friends and mentors don't know you are struggling, they can't help. You also have the department of Mental Health & Counseling at Yale Health which offers many resources and has an after-hours urgent line 203-432-0290.

I strongly encourage yoga, meditation, or other stress-relieving and mentally-clarifying activities. To that end I am very happy to take “walking” meetings, as I feel they are often more relaxing.

## Conference, School, and Workshop Travel

I aim to provide funding for two conferences (/schools/workshops) a year, ideally (in terms of cost- and carbon-effectiveness) one U.S. and one intercontinental conference per person per year. However, first year graduate students should limit their conference travel to one event in the first year. Yearly expenses should not exceed USD XXXX for PhD students and USD 5,000 for post-docs. If you are part time in the lab, resources are proportional to your time in the group.  Additional workshops are possible if they are low cost. Events that you don’t have to pay for should still be approved on a case-by-case basis. It is not in your best interest to spend too much time travelling and presenting, as each event eats up much more time than the event itself.  It’s also hypocritical from a climate perspective if we don't at least think of our carbon footprint. To obtain approval for a conference or workshop please fill out this Google form.

Students and postdocs are encouraged to seek co-funding from Yale or externally.  This helps in practicing grant application writing, plus it can go on your CV until you get a bigger grant. Securing funding is a key part of life as a scientist- regardless of whether you go into academia, governments, non-profits, etc. Therefore, I encourage all students to apply for funding – even if you are brought in on a fully funded project.

## Human subject protocols

Please contact me well in advance for any interview-based fieldwork so we can complete required ethics applications.

## Data and publishing policies

meta data

code

data sharing resources

A prerequisite to open science is knowing how to effectively organize your data. This includes managing raw data and analysis output, organizing and commenting your code, providing notes on every step of the analysis, organizing your project directories, and keeping track of changes in your pipeline and scripts. Here is an overview of "good enough" practices in this process -- lots of room for improvement, but this should be the minimum to strive for.

## Journal Submissions 

-Cover letters

Always include a cover letter and suggest reviewers!  Not doing so causes delays.  If you need a template, please let me know.

-Review
Always give me ample time to review the manuscript and cover letter before submission.

Public Presentations of Research 
All forms of public research presentations, whether conference talks, posters, or published papers reflect the entire research group and therefore must be approved by me prior to their presentation.  Please make sure to acknowledge your co-authors and funding sources somewhere in the presentation.

Outreach
We aim to conduct engaged research with inclusion of relevant stakeholders.

Please head over to https://sanford-lab.github.io/research/ and check out the description of the project that you are working on. I think all of these could be updated/improved, so please submit a pull request with an updated description of your project OR send me an updated description on Slack that I can add to the website.
